## 📚 Overview

The **Airline Reviews Sentiment Analysis** project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to assess customer sentiment from airline reviews. By classifying these reviews as positive or negative, this tool assists airlines and analysts in understanding customer satisfaction and improving service quality.

## 🔍 Project Details

### Objective
To build a reliable sentiment analysis model that classifies airline customer reviews and uncovers insights into overall customer experiences.

### Data Source
- **Collected From**: Scraped data from airline review platforms.
- **Content**: Customer reviews with accompanying sentiment labels reflecting their experiences.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Utilize web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup to gather reviews.
